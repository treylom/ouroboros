"""Inner-interviewer guidance contract for steering wrappers.

Any wrapper that composes ``InterviewEngine`` and prepends steering to its
system prompt must honor one rule: **the interview layer always has
priority**. Whatever guidance an unwrapped inner build retains completely
must also survive the steered build completely — steering yields otherwise.

This module owns both sides of that rule, so future wrappers (QA steering,
team-convention steering, …) get the guarantees without re-deriving them:

- Declaration: ``INNER_GUIDANCE_INVARIANTS`` — named, explained invariants
  that resolve their full marker texts per build.
- Enforcement: ``reserve_steering_extension`` + ``compose_steered_prompt``
  — the budget-extension composition in which steering rides in a reserved
  extension on the normal path (the inner build stays byte-identical to an
  unwrapped engine's designed-budget build) and falls back to atomic
  paragraph shedding when a caller-supplied cap cannot host both.

``interview.py`` itself is never modified; the extension is reserved via
instance attributes on the wrapper-owned engine only.
