"""PM Interview Engine — composition wrapper around InterviewEngine.

Adds PM-specific behavior on top of the existing InterviewEngine:
- Question classification (planning vs development)
- Reframing technical questions for PM audience
- Deferred item tracking for dev-only questions
- PMSeed generation from completed interview
- Brownfield repo management via the configured runtime database

The engine does not read repositories (RFC Q00/ouroboros#1937 decision 9).
Reading code belongs to the advisory lanes, which run in the session that fans
out and put their findings beside the question; an engine-side summary would be
evidence the person judging never receives.

Composition pattern: PMInterviewEngine *wraps* InterviewEngine without
modifying its internals. The inner engine handles question generation,
state persistence, and round management. The outer engine intercepts
questions for classification and collects PM-specific metadata.

    Scoring asks how clear the *requirements* are, and requirements are what
    the person decided.  What they weighed on the way is neither clearer nor

    reach the scorer: a well-researched question would otherwise read as a
    well-decided one, which is the same confusion ``check_completion`` avoids
    by counting decisions rather than rounds.

    The answer is dropped, not the round.  This mirrors the per-role rule in
    ``answer_provenance``: an observation is withheld from the slot that
    carries authority and left alone in the slot that carries the question.
    The scorer then sees the grounded question standing unanswered — which is
    what it is until the person answers it — so the finding raises the
    remaining ambiguity instead of lowering it.

    The initial-context summary round is passed through untouched.
    ``prompt_safe_initial_context`` recovers a long context from that answer,

        One planner call: the primary question travels exactly as
        :meth:`plan_next_turn` produces it, and companions ride the same JSON
        payload under ``companion_questions``. Each companion is classified and
        applied through the same ``_apply_classification`` path as the primary,
        so reframe tracking and skip routing do not know batch members apart.

        What is enforced here rather than trusted to the generator:

        * **Closure mode is single-question.** At or below the planner's
          closure threshold the batch is the primary alone — a companion is a
          second topic, and closure mode forbids opening one.
        * **No duplicate question identities in one batch.** Fan-out isolation
          keys on the normalized question text, so a companion that normalizes
          to an already-included question is dropped, not dispatched.
        * **The ceiling.** At most ``MAX_QUESTIONS_PER_TURN`` questions leave,
          however many the payload carried.

        A malformed companion entry is dropped silently: the primary is the
        turn, and companions are an optimization the turn must not fail on.
        What counts as malformed is not decided here — the companion's routing
        fields go through the primary's own classification parser, so a
        wrong-typed ``decide_later`` is refused by the same rule in both. What
        follows the refusal differs, because the two questions do: the primary
        falls back to a plain planning question, since the turn must have one,
        while a companion is dropped, since the turn is whole without it.
