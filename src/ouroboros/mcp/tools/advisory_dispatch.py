"""Interview advisory fan-out rendered onto the channel the host reads.

Companion to ``mcp/tools/advisory_prompts.py``. That module holds the words a
*child* is judged by; this one holds the words the *host* is instructed by. The
split is the audience, not the format: a child prompt may be rewritten freely,
while this text is a contract the host is expected to act on verbatim.

``_attach_question_assist_requests`` stamps the payloads, the correlation key,
and the host action onto the response ``meta``. On a ``PLUGIN_PASSIVE`` runtime
a bridge process sits between the server and the host model and reads that
metadata out of band, so nothing further is needed. ``HOST_DRIVEN`` and
``SEQUENTIAL`` runtimes have no such reader: the host *model* is the only
consumer, and the only channel it reads is response content. A contract
delivered solely through ``meta`` is therefore unobservable to exactly the
runtimes it addresses — the lanes are built, registered, and stamped, and the
host never learns a fan-out exists.

That is not a guess about one client. ``lateral_think`` already emits a visible
banner for this case "so meta-dropping transports still get a deterministic
cue" (#1517); the same commit added ``host_action`` to the interview advisory
and left the cue out, so that fan-out kept a ``MUST`` whose trigger no host
could observe.

The gap was silent in a way the fan-out's own vocabulary is not. A lane that
runs and finds nothing returns its no-op answer; a lane that is skipped comes
back ``partial``; a lane that could not be spawned is declarable
``undispatched``. A host that never learned the lanes existed produces none of
these — only an unredeemed registry record, and an interview that reads as
though no advice was ever due.

#:
#: The bridge declares itself with our marker and this opening rather than being

#: **A producer that appends dispatch state to the visible question declares it
#: with this grammar**, so the gatekeeper never has to reverse-engineer prose.
#: Two do: the host directive above and the bridge. The bridge went five rounds
#: undeclared, which is why the rule is written where the next one will read it.
#:
#: It is a rule about dispatch state, not about every append.
#: :func:`append_lateral_review_notice` also adds to the visible question and
#: does not declare, so an echo carrying only that notice is recorded verbatim.
#: That is a real residue and it is deliberately not fixed here: it predates this
#: lane, carries no identifiers, and belongs to whichever change needs it rather
#: than to the one that happened to notice it.

    A host is asked to echo back "the exact question you asked", and the text it
    was shown ends with the fan-out directive. That value becomes the recorded
    round's question, which requirement extraction reads and the Seed inherits,
    so an echo copied wholesale would write server-authored instructions into
    durable state.

    **The marker is recognised here, and that is safe in this direction only.**
    Three rounds were spent learning that an in-band sentinel cannot separate our
    output from a question quoting our output: each longer prefix was a longer
    thing to quote, and each round truncated a question someone could legitimately
    ask. What made that unsafe was not the recognition — it was that recognition
    licensed *cutting*, so a false positive destroyed the user's text.

    Here it licenses nothing but a preference for the record we already hold. A
    false positive costs a repair we did not need to make, because the stored
    question of an unanswered round is the question the server issued and asked
    about. So the worst case is keeping the right question, and no echo of any
    shape — the question alone, the ambiguity-prefixed form, the whole response
    body, a paraphrase with the directive still attached — can carry a directive
    past it. Enumerating those forms is what the previous approach had to do, and
    the list only grows.

    **The marker alone is not the test, and the false positive is not free.**
    For one round it was the test, and that broke the repair this exists to
    allow: a question quoting the marker with no directive under it was read as
    an echo, so the stored question won — and where the stored question is the
    damaged one ``last_question`` exists to replace, the damage is what reached
    the transcript. The argument for the bare marker was that the worst case is
    keeping the right question. That holds only while the stored question is
    right, which is precisely the case this parameter is not for.

    So it asks for a directive, not a mention. What remains is narrower and
    stated: a repair that reproduces a whole directive is not distinguishable
    from an echo, and preferring the record there is the safe reading.

    A non-string is not an echo; the caller's own validation rejects it.

    produced in the same call (``auto/adapters.py`` extracting the question it
    must answer), so there is no second copy to compare against and the shape is
    the only evidence there is.

    **Only call this when the server appended a directive**, which
    :func:`directive_was_appended` answers from the same response. With none
    present the last marker in the text belongs to the question, and cutting
    there destroys it — on ``PLUGIN_PASSIVE``, where content is left unchanged
    by design, that would be every turn.

    The gate is also what retires the residual an earlier version of this
    docstring accepted. A directive is always appended last, so once one exists
    the last marker is ours and a question quoting the sentinel survives in
    front of the cut.

    The shape question itself is asked in one place, :func:`_directive_at`, and
    both readers of a response ask it. What differs is the warrant each side has
    for the answer: this one removes text, and does so only after
    ``directive_was_appended`` has said the server wrote some; the echo side
    removes nothing and only prefers a record it already holds. Sharing the
    question keeps them from disagreeing about where a response ends; keeping
    the warrants apart is what stops the weaker one licensing a cut.

    It also asks only about ``_HOST_DIRECTIVE_OPENING``, because the gate it
    obeys is a statement about the server's own directive. The bridge declares
    with the same marker and appends *after* the server, so accepting its
    opening here would cut at the bridge's notice and leave the server's
    directive standing in the question.

    That earlier version also claimed the residual reached durable state only
    through the echo path, where it would be refused. It was wrong. A truncation
    here removes the marker, so the echo arrives looking like an ordinary
    question and is recorded as one — a guarantee stated where nothing made it
