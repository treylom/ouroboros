"""Prompt text for interview advisory lanes.

The Output section a lane is given, and the task line and standing brief the
``data_context`` lane carries. They live here rather than beside the payload
builder because they are the words a child is judged by: the Output section must
ask for exactly the contract re-entry enforces, and the data brief states the
boundaries the child cannot be trusted to rediscover.

Both defects this module has held were one prompt saying two things. The Output
section asked for fields the closed contract forbids; the task line banned
touching any tool while the brief permitted discovery. In each case the child
obeyed one half and was rejected — or, worse, quietly declined — for obeying it.
So the halves are kept together: co-location is not agreement, but it puts the
disagreement in front of whoever edits either one.

The second of those was repaired twice. Letting the lane discover made the two
halves agree, and the agreed position was still wrong: a lane that may look but
not call buys a user round trip and returns less than the sibling lanes that
simply ran. What #1754 set out to stop was a guess becoming the Seed's evidence,
and a ban on execution was the heavy instrument reached for to get it — it made
the guess likelier, not rarer. The lane executes now (Q00/ouroboros#1825), and
the boundary that survives is the one that was doing the work all along: a
number is material for the user's judgment and never the interview answer.

Extracted from ``mcp/tools/subagent.py`` (Q00/ouroboros#1754), which keeps
re-exports for its existing importers.

    return f"""Find out which data tools this host exposes before you judge anything else,
then use them. You may call them: the user registered these tools, and
registering one is the willingness to have it called.

That order is the point, not a formality. Whether a question's honest answer is
a measurement depends on what is held here, not on the question's grammar:
"what counts as completion, and at what point is it measured" reads as a request
for a definition where nothing is connected, and as "count which completion
events actually fire" where an event stream is. Judge it against what you found
described, not against the sentence alone.

Two rules govern how you say you found nothing, and they exist because this lane
got both of them wrong.

**A search result is not evidence of absence.** Descriptions and callable tools
answer different questions — descriptions say what stores exist and what they
hold, tool schemas say what you can invoke. A store can be described and its
tools unloadable at the instant you looked. So if a store is described, you may
only report it unreachable after you *attempted the call* and it failed. An
empty tool search is where you start looking, never where you stop.

**Every reason you give is about you, not about this host.** You are one
subagent inside someone's machine; you cannot see what is connected, only what
reached you. `no_data_store_described` says nothing you were shown holds this
answer. `store_described_but_not_callable` says something does and you could not
get to it — the parent sees the environment and will decide what that means.
Neither is "there is no data here", and you must not write a reason that says so:
that sentence has already been relayed to a user as a fact about their own
infrastructure while the store in question sat described in this very prompt.

Your output is material for the user's judgment, never the answer. This is the
whole of the boundary now that you carry real numbers, so it is the one line to
hold: the interview answer is the user's own words, whatever your numbers show.
Put the measurement beside the question, not in place of it, and never write a
finding in the shape of a decision the user has not made.

Only aggregates can be carried. If what you measured is a row list, a name, an
identifier, or an error message, that is data_needed=false with one of the listed
reasons — not evidence. Grouping keys must be categorical; grouping by an
identifier is a row list wearing an aggregate's clothes.

metric and informs_decision are read by the user beside your numbers, so write
what you would say to them: name the thing measured and the decision it serves.
Put the number in values, where it belongs — a figure narrated in prose is one
no consumer can find, bound, or date.
