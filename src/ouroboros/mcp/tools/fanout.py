"""Fan-out result re-entry: persisted request state + synthesizer routing.

A fan-out is one question's worth of subagent consultation. The producer (an
interview turn, a lateral panel, a code investigation) emits payloads and
registers what it expects back; the host spawns the children through its own
runtime and submits their correlated outputs to
``ouroboros_submit_fanout_results``; this module decides whether the
consultation is finished and hands the outputs on.

Everything persisted here is **request-side**: which lanes were asked, which of
them the answer cannot be completed without, what the correlation key is. No
child output is written to disk -- results are submitted, judged complete, and
returned in the same call. That boundary is why the record needs no
sanitization: there is nothing child-authored in it to sanitize.

Three properties this module holds:

**Completion reads requiredness.** A lane advertised as ``required: false`` --
in the request schema, in the child's prompt, in the payload context -- may be
absent without pinning the fan-out at ``partial`` forever. Its absence is
reported rather than dropped silently, because a lane that was asked for and did
not answer is information the host should see.

**A lane that never ran is not a lane that found nothing.** A child that runs
and has nothing to say returns its no-op answer; a child that could not be
dispatched at all returns nothing, and against a required lane that would be an
indefinite ``partial``. The host can declare the second case, which completes
the fan-out with that lane marked undispatched. Without this, the cheapest way
for a host to finish is to invent the missing output.

**Which lanes are contracted is read from the code, never from the record.** A
lane that declares an ``answer_contract`` has its submitted output checked
against what this build declares, and the record has no say in it. Persisting
the contract alongside the record was tried and removed: it turned a fact the
code guarantees into a value that could be absent, and an absent contract read
as "nothing to check" rather than as the anomaly it is. Validation is therefore
driven by what was submitted rather than by a map that could be missing an
entry. A violating lane is excluded from the aggregation and reported, so a
malformed or over-reaching answer does not reach the parent session as advice.

Extracted from ``mcp/tools/subagent.py`` (Q00/ouroboros#1754), which keeps
re-exports for its existing importers.

    ``tool_name`` names the issuing MCP tool when it is not the interview, and
    re-entry reads the answer contracts from that tool's catalog: a lane id
    alone does not say whose catalog, and both tools declare a ``data_context``.
    It is written only when it differs from the default so an interview record
    is byte-identical to what earlier versions wrote.

    ``roster_repo_ids`` bounds which repositories a lane may cite. It is
    per-session data the producer knew and re-entry cannot re-derive, so unlike
    the contracts it is persisted; a record without one is simply not bounded.

    The advisory lanes are stamped to correlate by ``context.lane_id`` (a lane's
    persona is absent on the ``code_context`` / ``web_context`` lanes), so the
    expected keys are the lane ids carried on the emitted payloads — exactly the
    keys the stamped ``question_advisory_result_correlation_key`` tells the host
    to submit under. This is the invariant #1578 broke: the producer stamped
    ``context.lane_id`` but registered a ``code_facts`` record, so a
    contract-following host was rejected with ``correlation_mismatch``.

    Requiredness travels with the lane ids. It is read from the same payload
    context the child's prompt prints it from, so the flag the child is shown
    and the flag completion enforces cannot disagree.

    So does ``question_identity``. A contracted lane's answer carries the
    question it claims to be about — and only the question: it asserts no
    session, because the submission envelope already binds that and a copy the
    child asserts about itself is the weaker of the two. The contract says the
    identity field "matches the originating advisory request", a sentence
    nothing enforced until this was persisted. Advisory children run
    asynchronously and a host may have several questions in flight, so an
    unbound answer is one whose evidence can land beside a different question
    than the one it measured.

    The answer contracts are not persisted with it. Which lanes are contracted
    is a property of the code, read from the code at re-entry; a copy in the
    record would be a fact the build guarantees turned into a value that could
    go missing. See ``_canonical_lane_contracts`` for what that copy cost and
    what removing it gives up.

    Advisory lanes have no gating synthesizer (each is independent advice to make
    the human's answer easier), so submission routes to a deterministic
    aggregation that returns the correlated lane outputs in dispatch order for
    the host to synthesize.

    spawn through one list, whatever became of it. Exactly that shape, though:
    an ``undispatched`` that is not the literal ``true``, or one arriving with
    ``content``, returns ``status="invalid_result_entry"`` rather than being
    read for what it might have meant. So does a lane reported twice: two
