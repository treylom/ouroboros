"""Batched PM turns (RFC #2222): a turn is asked whole and answered whole.

A batched turn puts one to three questions on the table at once. What this
module owns is everything that is *about the turn* rather than about one
question: how a turn renders to the host, how its answers come back, and how
they are recorded.

**A turn is atomic** (RFC #2222 revision 4). Nothing is persisted when a turn
is asked — no question-only round, no pending-member list — and a turn's
answers arrive together, so a round is written only when it is whole. That is
what removes the seam three review rounds kept finding: a pending list beside
the transcript is one fact in two places, and an interleaved write, an
interrupted one, or a question whose text recurs each turned that gap into a
lost or duplicated decision. There is no gap to guard now. A call that carries
no answers is a host that lost its turn; the next turn is planned from the
transcript rather than restored.

    A turn is one write now, but two calls for one interview can still be in

    interview state and writes it back, so interleaved they both report success
    while the later write carries a state that never saw the earlier one, and
    those decisions are gone.

    The call carrying no answers is not exempted. It looks read-only and it
    holds the lock through the next turn's generation, a real LLM call, so a
    timed-out host's retry queues behind it — but it plans a turn and persists

    """Store the lane briefs and leave references on the wire (RFC #2222).

    The same rule findings follow — bodies do not travel; ids do — applied to
    the plumbing itself. A turn's response used to carry each lane's full
    brief twice (meta and dispatch text) plus a copy of the tool's capability
    metadata per envelope, so one question cost ~120k characters and a batch
    outgrew what a host accepts inline, forcing hosts to improvise file
    surgery. After this, the response carries the questions and fetchable
    references; the briefs sit in the same store the children already fetch
    findings from.

    What travels is decided by what a child cannot work without: the answer
    schema (stripped of its descriptions), the roster it may cite, and the
    findings it may reuse all ride the stub, and the fetch carries only what
    explains them. The first shape of this put everything behind the fetch, and
    a lane that could not reach the store had no schema, no roster and no rules
    — one call away from having nothing to do.

    Fail-open on every edge: no store, no fanout id, or a publish that fails
    leaves the full prompts inline — today's behavior, oversized but whole.
