"""The question-advisory fan-out, shared by the interview and the PM interview.

The lanes are described entirely by the calling tool's catalog in the capability
registry — ``orchestration.question_advisory_fanout`` — read by tool name. What
each lane asks of its child, which are required, and which answer contract each
carries are read from there rather than written here.

One builder serves both tools. Where the two genuinely differ the branch is on
what the request carries rather than on which tool is calling, so no tool is
named on the payload path; where they do not differ the lane is reused outright
— the ``data_context`` lane's task and brief come from ``advisory_prompts``
unchanged.

The rule about what a child may do with a clear finding is the one thing that
does differ, and it is not written here either. It lives in each tool's catalog
as ``child_answer_rule`` and is rendered into the lane brief, so the rule the
child reads and the rule the catalog declares are one text rather than two
copies that can drift. In the interview a code fact may stand in for the
answer; in PM it may not — a PM finding is shown to the user for confirmation
and then travels the ordinary ``answer`` parameter, recorded as an adopted fact
and never as their decision.

`policy_claims` — that is how "I looked and it is clean" is said. A repository
you never opened has no entry at all. Give one repository two entries and the
answer is rejected. If nothing opened at all, `examined` is empty and
`nothing_examined_reason` says why: an empty roster and a repository that would
not open are their own reasons, never "no policy found".

**Disagreement is the finding, not a defect.** If two repositories implement
different policies, carry both under their own entries. Do not reconcile them,
pick a winner, or describe them as one policy with an exception. That
contradiction is the most useful thing you can hand a PRD author.

**Evidence comes from the roster.** If the answer is one directory over, outside
this list, that is not evidence and it will be rejected: report it in your
finding as a repository worth adding, and give it no entry.

**Stop while the answer is still useful.** Read the roster in order and stop
once you can answer, giving entries only to what you actually opened. A partial
scope named honestly is a complete answer; an exhaustive search that has not
returned is not one at all.

    too -- a lane whose own lane published nothing is handed no line either
    (RFC Q00/ouroboros#2167).

    Which lanes have a key at all is decided once, where the catalog is read
    (see ``_declared_lanes``); this only renders what it was handed.

    ``contracted`` selects what the block asks of a lane that cannot reach the
    fetch tool. A prose lane says so in its finding -- silence there would read
    as "nothing to reuse", the confusion RFC Q00/ouroboros#2167 exists to
    prevent. A contracted lane has no field for that sentence and no reader who
    would be misled by its absence: its answer carries claims about the
    system, validated against the roster identically whether the fetch worked,
    so it is told to keep its shape and investigate -- the offer's failure mode
    is the exact behaviour the lane had without the offer. Whether it fetched
    is the server's to observe, from the fetch calls themselves (#2223).

    **A place to find them, and nothing to work out about it.** This block used
    to hand over paths and then explain how to arrange what was inside them --
    which lanes to select, against which shape. A lane read that explanation,
    selected against the wrong shape, found nothing and re-investigated; nothing
    failed loudly, because a lane reporting no reusable findings looks exactly
    like a project having none. What removes that failure is not withholding the
    place: each entry pairs the contract with this lane's id, the fetch passes
    both back, and the store returns this lane's output alone -- so there is no
    arrangement left to describe and no instruction to carry out incorrectly.

    **The bodies stay in the store, and that is not a preference.** Carried
    inline they were duplicated into every lane of the turn; the tool result
    outgrew what a host accepts inline, was written to a file, and the host spent
    the turn parsing its own output rather than dispatching the fan-out. A block
    a lane never receives helps nobody.

    **The count is what makes fetching safe to require.** Naming how many are
    offered before naming the tool means a lane that cannot reach it knows
    something is there. Without that number, an unreachable tool and an empty
    project produce the same silence -- the confusion this whole mechanism
    exists to prevent. Offered, not published: the list is capped, so a count
    stated as a total would be a number this cannot know.

    **They may not be this session's.** A finding describes the system, and the
    system does not change at session granularity -- so the boundary is recency
    and another session's finding about this project is as good as this one's
    (RFC Q00/ouroboros#2153). What does not carry across is the roster: a
    session chooses which repositories it is asking about, and evidence from
    outside this session's roster is rejected at submission. The child is told
    so here, where it is deciding what to trust.

    What this must not become is a second set of rules. There is nothing here
    about proving a stored finding sufficient, reporting what a reuse left
    unsettled, or marking an answer as reused. Those would be bookkeeping about
    incompleteness, and what the answer contracts guard is that an answer cannot
    lie about its sources -- which holds whatever the child read.
