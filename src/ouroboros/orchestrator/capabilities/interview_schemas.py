#: Why no measurement is carried.  A closed set, because the reasons are known

#: "observed 41 accounts" had a sentence-shaped field to put it in; now it has a
#: choice of constants (Q00/ouroboros#1754).
#:
#: **Every reason is about the lane, never about the host.**  ``no_data_tool_``
#: ``available`` used to be here and was removed (Q00/ouroboros#1825): it is a
#: claim about the user's infrastructure, and a subagent is not positioned to
#: establish one.  It was reported for a question about EKS cost while five
#: observability MCP servers were connected and a Mimir store holding exactly
#: the container CPU/memory series sat described in the lane's own context --
#: the lane had no loadable tool schemas, read that as "no data path exists",
#: and the parent relayed it to the user as an actionable fact about their
#: infrastructure.  It was false, and it suppressed the only evidence that could
#: have bounded the answer.
#:
#: The two replacements split the claim by what the lane can decide for itself.
#: ``no_data_store_described`` says nothing in the descriptions it was given
#: holds this answer.  ``store_described_but_not_callable`` says one does and the
#: lane could not reach it -- which reaches the parent as "handle this", not as

    The read still names *what was measured* rather than how it was fetched:
    there is no query string here, and the surface that shows the number beside
    the question renders these fields, so the user reads the measurement rather
    than a dialect they would have to interpret.

    ``values`` is what changed when the lane was allowed to execute
    (Q00/ouroboros#1825). Before, the absence of a value field was the
    barrier: a child that ran a lookup had nowhere to put the result. That
    barrier is retired because it was aimed at the wrong thing -- what #1754 set
    out to stop was a guess becoming the Seed's evidence, and execution was the
    heavy instrument reached for to get it. The guard that actually holds is
    downstream and unchanged: nothing here becomes an interview answer, a
    requirement, or durable state.

    There is no ``observed_at``. It was required here for two rounds and is
    removed by RFC #1754's second revision: ageing is accepted unconditionally,
    so a field restating it bought nothing a consumer read. The envelope that
    reasoning named was the interview session; RFC #2153 supersedes that with
    recency, on the reasoning that a measurement moves on the system's clock
    rather than on the clock of whoever is being interviewed. What is unchanged
    is why no field is needed: the aggregate is shown beside the question and
    the user answers in their own words, so its age is theirs to weigh. It also asked an LLM child with
    no clock to testify about time, which cost three rounds of validators —
    digits, then component ranges, then a wall clock with a skew allowance. The
    close is structural rather than another validator: a field that does not
    exist cannot carry an impossible time.

    **A grouped value carries its label, or the read is not grouped.** This is a
    ``oneOf`` over two closed shapes for the same reason the answer itself is:
    one object with an optional ``group`` accepted ``group_by=["region","plan"]``
    beside ``values=[{"value": 41}]`` -- every category lost, and two different
    aggregates rendered identically -- and equally accepted a label on a read
    that declared no grouping at all. A field that is optional where it is
    required is a field that is not required.

    ``group_by`` takes one key rather than four. Four keys were never
    representable: a single ``group`` string cannot say which key it labels, so
    the extra capacity only bought ways to be ambiguous. One key with a required
    label is what this shape can carry honestly, and a question needing two is a
    second read.

def _interview_data_evidence_answer_contract() -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Return the answer contract for the ``data_context`` advisory lane.

    Four properties this schema holds by shape rather than by rule.

    **The child does not classify the tool it names, and now runs it anyway.**
    There is no ``source_class`` here, and the reason is unchanged: whoever
    knows a tool is who classifies it. That is the rule the sibling lanes
    follow -- ``code_context`` runs on ``Read`` / ``Glob`` / ``Grep``, handed to
    the child *with* their ``mutation_class`` read out of ``_BUILTIN_SEMANTICS``
    so it picks from a list rather than rating anything, and ``web_context``
    names no tool at all. Only ``data_context`` reaches tools the server has
    never seen: a host's warehouse, its Metabase, its analytics MCP.

    That asymmetry used to be the argument for this lane proposing while the
    host executed. It no longer is (Q00/ouroboros#1825). ``operation: "read"``
    is still a label on the request rather than a constraint on the tool, and
    RFC #1754's finding still holds -- "a tool's name cannot prove it is
    read-only [...] a child judging 'obviously local, free, read-only' from
    names and descriptions is not a boundary." What changed is what follows
    from it. The confirmation gate it justified could not price what it was
    gating: MCP carries no cost or mutation metadata, so the host had nothing
    true to disclose, and a disclaimer attached to every read is a thing users
    learn to click through. It bought a round trip and a worse answer.

    So the risk is accepted rather than mitigated by ceremony, and stated here
    so it is accepted knowingly: a metered warehouse call or a write can arrive
    named like a free local read, and this lane will make it. The standing
    consent is the same one every other advisory lane already runs on -- the
    user registered the MCP server, and registering it is the willingness to
    have it called. What made this lane different was never the tools; it was
    that this lane alone was asked to hold the line in prose.

    **A measurement can be reported, and still cannot become the answer.**
    ``values`` exists now. A child that ran a lookup hands the aggregate back.

    The shape still refuses everything that is not an aggregate. ``value`` is a
    number, so a row, a name, an identifier, or an error message has no
    representation and a result that is one of those is a
    ``NoMeasurementNeeded`` answer instead. ``group_by`` keys are identifiers
    and ``values`` is bounded, because grouped numbers without a bound are a row
    list wearing an aggregate's name.

    ``values`` may be empty, and that is not a missing answer. A read that ran
    and came back with nothing is a measurement, frequently the informative one
    -- the observation that moved this decision was "zero cost-series metrics
    exist", which is exactly this shape. A minimum of one would have made the
    finding unspellable, and left the child nowhere to go: no
    ``no_evidence_reason`` means "I measured and it was empty", so it would have
    had to pick a reason that was false. An empty ``values`` is the read
    attesting that it ran and came back with nothing, which an absent answer
    cannot say.

    Every bound here is named in the field's own description for the same
    reason. This lane is ``required: true`` and a contract violation is popped
    from the aggregation, so a limit the child cannot see is not a limit -- it
    is a stall the user experiences as the lane having nothing to say.

    What the missing value field was protecting is not the schema, and never
    was. RFC #1754 opens on it: "an interview question whose honest answer is a
    number got a guess, and the guess became the Seed's evidence." The guard
    against that is downstream and untouched -- the user answers in their own
    words, there is no ``[from-data]`` answer path, ``[from-data]`` is withheld
    from requirement extraction on every generation path, and the record keeps
    no child-authored content. A number reaches the user's judgment and stops
    there. Withholding the number too was the heavier instrument, and it made
    the guess more likely rather than less.

    The free-text fields keep the property they had: ``metric``,
    ``informs_decision`` and a filter's ``value`` are read by a human, so they
    can contain a number, and looking for one is the search ten rounds of #1703
    showed does not converge -- a ``caveats`` array was removed rather than
    watched for exactly this reason. That was never the boundary. The boundary
    is that nothing here becomes an interview answer, a requirement, or durable
    state.

    **An answer is one of two states, and cannot be between them.** The schema
    is a ``oneOf`` over two closed objects rather than one object with
    conditions: ``NoMeasurementNeeded`` carries a reason and no measurements,
    ``MeasurementTaken`` carries measurements and has no field for a reason.

    It was the other shape first, and that shape leaked. One object with
    ``if``/``then`` pairs constrains only the fields each pair names, so a field
    belonging to one state stayed spellable in the other until someone forbade
    it by name -- and an answer could say ``data_needed: true`` with a concrete
    read *and* ``no_evidence_reason``, which is "this question is measurable"
    and "this question is not a measurement" in one payload. Nothing downstream
    resolves that; the host renders a measurement the same answer disowned. The
    fix is not to forbid that pair but to stop having a place where a pair from
    two states can meet, so the next field added to one state cannot leak into
    the other by nobody remembering to exclude it.

    **A no-op is an answer, not an absence.** ``NoMeasurementNeeded`` is a
    complete, valid response. The lane is ``required: true`` precisely because
    this response always exists, so a question that is not data-driven
    completes the fan-out rather than stalling it.

    **The answer names the question it was drafted for, and nothing else.**
    There is no ``session_id`` here. The session is settled by the submission
    envelope, which rejects a fan-out submitted under a different session before
    any content is examined; a session the child asserts about itself restates
    that check in the weaker of the two directions, since the assertion and the
    envelope arrive in the same call and only one of them was written by the
    producer. The sibling ``code_investigation`` contract carries a session
    because its output becomes a ``[from-code]`` interview answer; this lane's
    output is a measurement shown beside the question, so ``question_identity``
    is
    the whole of what has to match (Q00/ouroboros#1754).
    """
    # Both question namespaces, because this contract is reused unchanged by the
    # PM interview (RFC #1937) and a pattern naming one tool would reject the
    # other's identities outright -- a lane rejected for its host's prefix has
    # nothing it could have submitted instead.
    #
    # Widening the shape does not widen the binding. Shape is not provenance:
    # ``_provenance_violations`` compares this value against the identity the
    # producer wrote into the fan-out record, so an answer still belongs to
    # exactly one question. What the pattern rules out is a free-text field, and
    # it goes on doing that.
