"""Schemas for the PM interview's advisory lanes (RFC Q00/ouroboros#1937).

The PM interview fans out the same way the regular interview does, with two
deliberate differences that both fall out of one sentence: *a finding is
evidence the PM reads before answering; it is never an answer.*

**Two lanes, not six.** Only the lanes that fetch evidence carry over — what the
code does today, and what the data says. A lane that critiques the question or
narrows it into options produces a draft judgment, not evidence, and a draft
wears the face of material while standing in for the decision.

**Findings are shown, not recorded** (RFC #2222 decision 4). An earlier design
let a confirmed finding occupy a round of its own, carried into the transcript
by an ``answer_prefix`` the lane declared and gated by a confirmation the PM had
to give. Both are retired: the round duplicated the published fan-out, which is
already addressable and re-offered, and the gate spent a turn to record what the
store already held. The v2 code-lane contract has no ``answer_prefix``, no
``requires_user_confirmation`` and no ``user_confirmation_prompt`` — with
nothing recorded there is nothing to gate, and the closed shape rejects an
answer that still carries them. Interview rounds carry the PM's own words.

What each claim gains instead is a lane-authored ``plain_statement``: the
product-language sentence the screen renders, in the question's own language,
with no paths or identifiers. Citations stay in the published fan-out, which is
where the record belongs. The prohibition is enforced by removing the place
rather than by growing a list of forbidden values — the same move the data lane
made when a typed read request replaced its free-text query field (#1754/#1825).

Two doors were the alternative, and the cost was measured. PM originally kept
no answer path at all and grew a second entrance for findings — an ``evidence``
parameter no sibling tool has. Two entrances meant two sets of rules for the
same payload, and seven review rounds found the same class of silent loss at a
new address each time. Removing the entrance is what closed it.

**What holds when a host skips the confirmation anyway.** The prompt is shown by
the host, so the contract can ask for it but not perform it. The guarantee that
does not depend on the host is downstream and structural: any answer opening
with ``[from-code]`` settles as ``provenance="observation"`` where it enters, so
requirement extraction reads :data:`~ouroboros.bigbang.answer_provenance.
WITHHELD_ANSWER_NOTE` in its place and completion counts only rounds whose
provenance is ``"user"``. An unconfirmed forward costs a question turn; it
cannot become a PRD requirement and cannot end the interview.

**The forwarded text is composed from the ``examined`` entries, not from a
free-text field.** There is deliberately no ``answer_text`` here. Every claim
the host forwards therefore carries the repository it was checked against — the
entry it sits in — and a repository-relative ``path``, which a prose field would
have let it shed.

That structure is also why the lane's scope cannot contradict its claims. Scope
and claim were two lists once, and an answer could declare one repository
examined while citing another's code; folding them into per-repository entries
made the contradiction unspellable rather than checked (RFC #1937 decision 7).

``data_context`` is reused verbatim from the interview. It already works this
way: no confirmation, no grade, closed answer states, and no ``[from-data]``
answer path — measurements are shown beside the question and the answer is the
user's own words. The new surface is exactly one contract, for the code lane.

    The lane id is the interview's, deliberately: it names a role — bring what
    the code says about this question — and both tools want that role. What
    differs is the contract, and a contract is what the catalog attaches per
    tool. A second lane id for the same role would have said the roles differ,
    which is the one thing that is not true here.

    **Scope and claim live in one place.** This lane first carried them in two
    lists -- ``examined_repository_ids`` for what it read, ``evidence[]`` for
    what it found -- and review round 8 showed an answer declaring only the API
    repository examined while citing the web repository's code, accepted as
    complete. Two lists about the same subject can always drift, and a check
    comparing them would have closed that one drift while leaving the shape that
    produced it. They are folded instead: ``examined`` is one list of
    per-repository entries, each carrying the claims found in that repository,
    so a claim's repository is the entry it sits in. Citing a repository outside
    the declared scope is not rejected here, it is unspellable.

    Three closed states, and the discriminator is the entries rather than a flag
    beside them. ``policy_found`` is gone for the reason the fold happened at
    all: a boolean restating what the entries already show is one more thing
    that can disagree with them. So is
    ``no_policy_found_in_examined_repositories`` -- entries with no claims say
    exactly that, and say which repositories it was true of.

    - ``NothingExamined`` -- no repository was read, and
      ``nothing_examined_reason`` says why. This is the only state carrying a
      reason, because it is the only one where the entries cannot speak.
    - ``NoPolicyInExaminedRepositories`` -- repositories were read and none
      implements policy bearing on the question. Every entry carries no claim,
      which is what keeps "found nothing across two of five" different from
      "found nothing across all five".
    - ``PolicyCarried`` -- at least one entry carries a claim. ``contains`` is
      what makes this state unreachable without one.

    No forwarding fields (RFC #2222). A finding is evidence shown beside the
    question, never an answer recorded on the user's behalf: the published
    fan-out is already the durable record of what was found, and the interview
    rounds carry only what the user themselves wrote. The v1 contract carried
    ``answer_prefix`` / ``requires_user_confirmation`` /
    ``user_confirmation_prompt`` to gate a recorded adopted fact; with nothing
    recorded there is nothing to gate, and the closed shape means an answer
    carrying those fields is rejected rather than quietly honoured.

    ``examined`` is required in all three states, empty list included. It is
    what keeps the lane's reporting about itself: "no policy found" means
    nothing about the PM's repositories until it says which ones were read, and
    a session whose roster failed to load reports an empty list rather than
    silently reading as "searched everywhere and found nothing". A repository
    the lane never opened simply has no entry, which is what makes stopping
    early -- the behaviour the lane brief asks for -- reportable honestly.
