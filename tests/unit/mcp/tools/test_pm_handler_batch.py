"""Batched PM turns (RFC #2222 revision 4): asked whole, answered whole.

The decisions these hold:

* **A turn persists nothing when it asks.** No question-only round, no pending
  member list. The transcript holds finished rounds only, so there is no second
  place a turn is remembered and nothing to reconcile after an interruption.
* **A turn's answers arrive together**, each holding its own question. Answer
  and question are never matched against remembered state, so a question whose
  text recurs later is just another question.
* **An answer without its question is refused.** Nothing is remembered to file
  it under, and the round behind it is one somebody already answered.
* **A call with no answers plans a fresh turn** rather than restoring one.
* Every question shown keeps its evidence: one advisory envelope per question,
  none shared, none skipped.
