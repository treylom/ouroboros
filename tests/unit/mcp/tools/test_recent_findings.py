"""Recent findings reach a lane, and the boundary is recency (RFC #2153).

The decision these hold is that a lane may answer from a finding another lane
produced recently, whichever session produced it — so what is asserted here is
mostly the *absence* of a session, and absences have no failing behaviour to
point at later if a guard is quietly restored.

What travels is where a finding is, not what it says: a count, a contract id
and a publication time, which a lane fetches for itself. So these read the
prompt for the id and assert the body is *not* in it -- carried inline, the same
block was copied into every lane of the turn and the response outgrew what a
host takes inline, which cost the turn its fan-out entirely.

A lane is offered only what its own lane produced (RFC #2167), so the lanes that
produce nothing reusable are asserted to receive no block at all.

Every fixture publishes **through the store**, because that is the change these
tests exist to protect. A fixture writing bodies into the directory by hand
would assert against the shape this feature deliberately stopped trusting.
